# Reflexion Question

What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
**  THE High-contrast accessibility enhancement is the most challenging to implement, because
    the color choice is ranging from small to a big differences. Unless we use tool, hard to master it

How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
**  They provide descriptive information to the users who have limitation such as roles, properties and state

What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
**  I used the WEBAIM to check the color contrans. I simply select the foreground and background color section
    and it simply tells me if the text passes or fails the color conterast.
